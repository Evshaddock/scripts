# My Scripts

**Update:** I have decided to break a lot of the bigger scripts out of here, and into their own repos, you can find them here:

[Surface Pro 2 Rotate](https://github.com/robinuniverse/SurfacePro2-Rotate), [scrcpy-netscan]( https://github.com/robinuniverse/Screencopy-Netscan), [Minecraft Server Management Scripts](https://github.com/robinuniverse/DomiServ), [clipdl](https://github.com/robinuniverse/clipdl), [blur](https://github.com/robinuniverse/blur), [PurgeBot](https://github.com/robinuniverse/PurgeBot), and [DARKER](https://github.com/robinuniverse/DARKER)

Hi! I'm Robin. I make a lot of really small things to help me in my day-to-day, and I've found that fairly often, coming across random repos full of small scripts can mean the difference between an afternoon of work and being able to just get something done, so I like to release all of the small scripts I do under the [Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)

## asm test - Assembly
Just me noodling around with assembly. Not much here

## mc-afk-fisher - Bash
Basically just a simple bash / xdotool script that lets you use an AFK fish farm in minecraft more easily while freeing up your mouse to do other stuff

## notify - Bash
This is kinda specific, but basically it's a tool made to watch a folder, and when a new file appears, send a message to discord using my other project, Discho. This has a few paths and messages specific to my machine, but it can be easily tweaked to work for other stuff

## obs-control - Python
This is a basic CLI interface for OBS Web Requests, mostly for use in scripts. it allows you to programatically change the current scene and profile in OBS

## spotify-to-discord - Bash
This script is likely borked by now, due to changes in the youtube api, but it basically attempts to find out what song you're listening to on spotify on youtube, and then links that youtube video to discord using Discho

## tvname - Python
Basically just a simple script that will loop through and create a list of "Series eXXsXX" strings based on what input you give it, ie `the Legend Of Korra 24 24 32` will print out a list of names for 3 seasons of the show, the first 2 24 episodes long, and the last one 32 episodes long. I wrote this because naming episodes when ripping box sets of DVDs is a huge pain

## twitch-chat-reader
This is mostly useless now, but back when it worked it would basically output a pretty looking twitch chat to your terminal, it would also read out the text using a exploit in acapella group's text to speech service
