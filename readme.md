# My Scripts

Hi! I'm Robin. I make a lot of really small things to help me in my day-to-day, and I've found that fairly often, coming across random repos full of small scripts can mean the difference between an afternoon of work and being able to just get something done, so I like to release all of the small scripts I do under the [Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)

## Darker - Graphics
This is a GIMP theme that makes gimp darker. It also gets rid of (hides) the mascot in the background for a more clean look

## PurgeBot - Python
This is a simple python discord bot that wipes up to 14 days worth of messages from a given channel

## asm test - Assembly
Just me noodling around with assembly. Not much here

## blur - Python
This is a script to allow you to easily assign KDE blur to chosen window, using devilspie

## clipdl - Bash
This is a bash script that when activated, will take any link in your clipboard, try to figure out what site it's from, and try to download it to the appropriate folder, ie., downloading soundcloud links as mp3s, twitter links as videos, weird twitter image links as jpegs, etc., etc.,

## mc-afk-fisher - Bash
Basically just a simple bash / xdotool script that lets you use an AFK fish farm in minecraft more easily while freeing up your mouse to do other stuff

## minecraft-server-management - Bash + Python
This is a big load of scripts that I use to manage my minecraft servers easily, and it includes my cloth test server management script, which has a LOT of functionality, but for now is a bit too focused on cloth specifically. I do plan on making it generic and releasing it as it's own project, some day

## notify - Bash
This is kinda specific, but basically it's a tool made to watch a folder, and when a new file appears, send a message to discord using my other project, Discho. This has a few paths and messages specific to my machine, but it can be easily tweaked to work for other stuff

## obs-control - Python
This is a basic CLI interface for OBS Web Requests, mostly for use in scripts. it allows you to programatically change the current scene and profile in OBS

## scrcpy-netscan - Bash
This is made to be a utility for using scrcpy on new / unknown networks quickly. You feed it the MAC address of your device, and it attempts to scan the network for the IP of your device, before attempting to connect you to it via scrcpy

## spotify-to-discord - Bash
This script is likely borked by now, due to changes in the youtube api, but it basically attempts to find out what song you're listening to on spotify on youtube, and then links that youtube video to discord using Discho

## surface-pro-2-rotate - Bash + Python
This is a script made to enable automatic rotation detection on the surface pro 2, including orientating the touch matrix correctly. It works as a toggle, so running the bash script will lock and unlock automatic orientation detection

## tvname - Python
Basically just a simple script that will loop through and create a list of "Series eXXsXX" strings based on what input you give it, ie `the Legend Of Korra 24 24 32` will print out a list of names for 3 seasons of the show, the first 2 24 episodes long, and the last one 32 episodes long. I wrote this because naming episodes when ripping box sets of DVDs is a huge pain

## twitch-chat-reader
This is mostly useless now, but back when it worked it would basically output a pretty looking twitch chat to your terminal, it would also read out the text using a exploit in acapella group's text to speech service
